How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

How I start creating a program that is meant to be reused and adaptable is by right at the beginning of the program I set variables that will call in other objects. This will allow for a simple change of variables at the beginning of the program to allow for the change between different situations. For example, in the CRUD program I made, I called the database and stored it in a variable. If I needed to call a different database, all I would have to change is the called in file, other then that the whole program uses the variable, so nothing needs to be changed.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?



How I always approach a problem is always by making the program part by part. When a program is done piece by piece, it helps figure out where things break. Another trick is to constantly compile when some code is done. This also helps prevent problems from happening. The last thing that I do to make sure a problem wonâ€™t happen is that I use multiple different IDEs when writing a program. Sometimes the problem only happens in a specific IDE. In a previous class I would use a one IDE to write the program, but I would debug it in visual studio because it has a code handling API that tells me what the mistakes are and how to fix them.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?


What computer scientist do is use science, robotics, and technology to create machines and programs to help make tasks easier for people. They make machines to make everyday life easier. With the example of the database project, it is possible to read the database manually but with the help of the python code, it can be searched more efficiently and faster then reading each line by itself.
